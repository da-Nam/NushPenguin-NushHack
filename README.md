# NushPenguin-NushHack
To use this rather sussy software, if you are on a debian-based linux distro (ubuntu, kubuntu, .....), you can probably just clone this github repo and run the executable file (`nushpenguin_buld.x86_64`).
For other people on other systems, you should probably download godot version 4.1.3 - stable and clone this project then import the project into it through the project.godot file.
