# NushPenguin-NushHack
1. How To Run:

To use this rather sussy software, if you are on a debian-based linux distro (ubuntu, kubuntu, .....), you can probably just _clone_ this github repo and run the executable file (`nushpenguin_buld.x86_64`).  
For other people on other systems, you should probably _download_ [godot version 4.1.3 - stable](https://godotengine.org/) and _clone_ this project then import the project into it through the project.godot file.

The multiplayer here is by LAN connections. It is up to the user to obtain the correct address and port and stuff for it to work. Considering that this is more of a proof of concept, it is recommended to run all the instances on *one device* for quick and easy testing. If you're using it to host a server on your own machine and want non-LAN clients to connect to it, you'll probably have to forward the server port on your router (haven't tried because school wifi lol).

2. Work Distribution Matrix:
- Nam: mutiplayer, character and world logic
- Edrik: slides and character sprites.
